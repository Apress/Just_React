Dear readers from the US,

I would like to bring to your attention a linguistic variation present in my book. Throughout the writing process, I adhered to Australian English, using the terms 'enrolment' and 'enrol.' I understand that in US English, the preferred spelling is 'enrollment' and 'enroll.' I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Please rest assured that this was not due to a lack of spell or proof checking.  I hope this clarification helps you enjoy the book, and I appreciate your understanding.

Thank you for your attention and support, and I hope you find the book enjoyable.
